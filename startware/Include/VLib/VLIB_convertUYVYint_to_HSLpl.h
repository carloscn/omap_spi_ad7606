/**
 * @par Introduction and Use Cases:
 *   HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness), also known as HSI (Hue Saturation Intensity), or HSB (Hue Saturation
 *   Brightness) is a popular color space for image representation, especially in computer graphics and other
 *   applications where color perception needs to be modeled better than with RGB. If the input data is in
 *   the interleaved YUV422 color format, this function transforms the data into the HSL format and separates
 *   the three color channels into separate buffers, color planes.
 *
 * @par Description:
 *   This function calculates HSL (Hue,Saturation and Lightness) representation of pixels
 *   represented in interleaved YUV422 format.
 * @par
 *   The matrix coefficients specified by the array coeff are typically as shown
 *   in Equation (a) for the case of RGB levels that correspond the 219-level range
 *   of Y. Expected ranges are [16..235] for Y and [16..240] for Cb and Cr.
 *   - coeff[] = { 0x2000, 0x2BDD, -0x0AC5, -0x1658, 0x3770 } ;  (a)
 * @par
 *   Alternatively, as shown in Equation (b), for the case of RGB conversion with
 *   the 219-level range of Y expanded to fill the full RGB dynamic range.
 *   Expected ranges are [16..235] for Y and [16..240] for Cb and Cr.
 *   - coeff[] = { 0x2543, 0x3313, -0x0C8A, -0x1A04, 0x408D } ; (b)
 * @par
 *   The division table is used to provide an LUT to replace integer divisions
 *   by multiplications with corresponding inverses, shifted left by 15.

 *   @param [in]  *yc         Interleaved luma/chroma                      (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]   width      Width of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   pitch      Pitch of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   height     Height of input image(number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   coeff      Matrix coefficients                          (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [in]   div_table  Division table                               (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [out] *H          Pointer to H plane (16-bit)                  (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [out] *S          Pointer to S plane (8-bit)                   (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [out] *L          Pointer to L plane (8-bit)                   (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - width should be a multiple of 8, and greater than 0
 *  - pitch should be a multiple of 4, and >= width
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
