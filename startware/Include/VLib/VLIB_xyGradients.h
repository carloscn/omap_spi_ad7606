/**
 * @par Description:
 *  For each pixel in the image, this function extracts the horizontal and vertical 1st order gradients. This is the same
 *  functionality as the \ref VLIB_xyGradientsAndMagnitude except the magnitude extraction has been removed to improve
 *  performance in applications which do not need magnitude values.  Gradients are 2D vectors which point in the direction
 *  of the greatest rate of change, in this case, in intensity. This function extracts the 2D gradient vector coordinates.
 *
 * @par Method:
 *  The first order 3x3 gradient filter calculates the first derivative in both the horizontal and vertical directions,
 *  Gx and Gy, respectively. So for the image pixel I(x,y), we calculate the gradients as shown in the following equations:
 *
 * @verbatim

    Gx = I(x+1,y) - I(x-1,y)
    Gy = I(x,y+1) - I(x,y-1)

    Gx and Gy are both signed, 16-bit values.
   @endverbatim
 *
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  *pIn       Pointer to array containing input image (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [out] *pGradX    Pointer to array containing X gradient (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [out] *pGradY    Pointer to array containing Y gradient (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [in]   width     Input width (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]   height    Input height (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - Calculating the 2D gradients vectors will require a 1-pixel border, so the gradient outputs will have a 1-pixel
 *      border of invalid data. The gradient filter has no memory boundary alignment requirements.
