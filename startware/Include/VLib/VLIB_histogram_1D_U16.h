 * @par Description
 *  Computes histogram from array of 16-bit unsigned integers using user-specified bins.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]     *X            Input array of scalar                                                   (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]      numX         Number of elements in X                                                 (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]      numBins      Number of bins                                                          (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]      binWeight    Value to accumulate in histogram bins                                   (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *histArray    Array for internal use, initialized by \ref VLIB_histogram_1D_Init_U16  (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *H1           Array for internal use                                                  (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in,out] *H            Array to hold the computed histogram                                    (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - histArray should be initialized by calling \ref VLIB_histogram_1D_Init_U16.
 * - H[k] will hold the number of elements that satisfy the following equation:
 *     - binEdges[k] <= X[i] < binEdges[k+1] (for k=0 .. numBins-2)
 * - The last bin H[numBins-1] will hold the number of elements that satisfy the following equation:
 *     - X[i] == binEdges[numBins-1]
 * - All values below binEdges[0] and above binEdges[numBins-1] will not be accumulated in any of the
 *   bins.
 * - H, and H1 should be of length numBins, initialized to 0.
 * - numX should be a multiple of 2
 * - numBins should be a multiple of 2
 * - X should be 4 byte aligned
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
