 * @par Description
 *  Computes weighted histogram from array of 8-bit unsigned integers using user-specified bins.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]     *X            Input array of scalar                                                        (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]      numX         Number of elements in X                                                      (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]      numBins      Number of bins                                                               (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]     *binWeight    Array of size numX of weight that each element contributes to the histogram  (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *histArray    Array for internal use, initialized by \ref VLIB_histogram_1D_Init_U8        (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]     *H1           Array for internal use                                                       (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *H2           Array for internal use                                                       (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *H3           Array for internal use                                                       (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in,out] *H            Array to hold the computed histogram                                         (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - histArray should be initialized by calling \ref VLIB_histogram_1D_Init_U8.
 * - H[k] will hold the number of elements that satisfy the following equation:
 *     - binEdges[k] <= X[i] < binEdges[k+1]
 * - The last bin H[end] will hold the number of elements that satisfy the following equation:
 *     - X[i] == binEdges[end]
 * - H, H1, H2, and H3 should be of length numBins, initialized to 0.
 * - numX should be a multiple of 4
 * - numBins should be a multiple of 2
 * - X, H, H1, H2, and H3 should all be 4 byte aligned
 * - binWeight should be 8 byte aligned
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
