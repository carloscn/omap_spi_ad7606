/**
 * @par Introduction and Use Cases:
 *   When the image data is stored in the YUV422 format but the processing needs to be done on its
 *   luminance component only, it is often desirable to extract the Y component and store it in a separate
 *   buffer. This is particularly useful when data needs to be contiguous.
 *
 * @par Description:
 *   This function extracts the luminance data from the YUV422 interleaved image. This is done by extracting
 *   every other byte and copying it to the buffer pointed to by pOutY.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  *pInUYVY       Input YUV422 image          (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]   inCols        Width of input image        (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   inPitch       Pitch of input image        (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   inRows        Height of input image       (in pixels)
 *   @param [out] *pOutY         Luma-only output image      (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - inCols should be a multiple of 16, and greater than 0
 *  - inPitch should be a multiple of 4, and >= inCols
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *  - Internally, there are 2 modes:
 *    - Mode 1: Most efficient mode is when inPitch == inCols
 *    - Mode 2: Kernel supports when inPitch > inCols, but less performance
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
