/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function calculates the Integral image of an 8-bit image.
 *
 * @par
 * @param [in]     pIn[]        8-bit input image                  (UQ8.0)
 * @param [in]     inCols       Width of input image (in pixels)   (UQ16.0)
 * @param [in]     inRows       Height of input image (in pixels)  (UQ16.0)
 * @param [in,out] pLastLine[]  32-bit carry-over buffer           (UQ32.0)
 * @param [out]    pOut[]       32-bit output data                 (UQ32.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - inCols must be a multiple of 8 pixels.
 *  - The arguments pIn, pOut, and pLastLine must be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - pIn is a pointer to an (inCols x inRows) array of 8-bit.
 *  - pOut is a pointer to an (inCols x inRows) array of 32-bit data.
 *  - pLastLine is a pointer to an (inCols x 1) array of 32-bit data.
 *  - The data pointed to by pLastLine needs to be initialized to 0s before first call on an image.  This buffer is
 *    intended to be used as a carry-over state buffer beteen subsequent calls on the same image.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
