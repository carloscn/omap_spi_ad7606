/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function can be used to calculate the next level of a pyramid. Given a pointer to a
 *  rectangular region of interest described by W (input data width), P (input data pitch),
 *  and H (input data height), this kernel returns (W-4)/2 x (H-3)/2 values. For example,
 *  if H=5, it will calculate a single row of results. The antialiasing filter used
 *  is a binomial approximation to the 5x5 Gaussian filter given by:

 *  @param [in]  *pIn     Input image                                     (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]  *pB      5 x (width-4) temporary array (not used)        (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [in]   width   Input width                                     (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [in]   pitch   Pitch of the input data                         (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [in]   height  Input height                                    (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [out] *pOut    Output image                                    (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - *pB is deprecated in this version of the function (the _cn version uses this), can be set to 0.
 * - width must be a multiple of 4
 * - pitch should be greater than or equal to width, and must be a multiple of 4
 * - height must be greater than 4
 * - pIn is a pointer to an (pitch x height) array of unsigned 8 bit data, and should be aligned to
 *   a 4 byte boundary.
 * - pOut is a pointer to an (width-4)/2 x (height-3)/2 array of unsigned 8 bit data, and should
 *   be aligned to a 2 byte boundary.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
