/**
 * @par Description:
 *  For each pixel in the image, the 2nd step in Canny edge detection extracts the horizontal and vertical 1st
 *  order gradients along with an approximation of the gradient magnitude. Gradients are 2D vectors which
 *  point in the direction of the greatest rate of change, in this case, in intensity.
 *  This function extracts the 2D gradient vector coordinates as well as magnitude.
 *
 * @par Method:
 *  The first order 3x3 gradient filter calculates the first derivative in both the horizontal and vertical directions,
 *  Gx and Gy, respectively. So for the image pixel I(x,y), we calculate the gradients and approximate the magnitude
 *  as shown in the following equations:
 *
 * @verbatim

    Gx = I(x+1,y) - I(x-1,y)
    Gy = I(x,y+1) - I(x,y-1)
    Gmag = (|Gx| + |Gy|)

    Gx, Gy and Gmag are all signed, 16-bit values.

 *   @param [in]  *pIn       Pointer to array containing input image (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [out] *pGradX    Pointer to array containing X gradient (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [out] *pGradY    Pointer to array containing Y gradient (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [out] *pMag      Pointer to array containing magnitude (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [in]   width     Input width (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]   height    Input height (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - When this is used in the \ref VLIB_Canny_Edge_Detection function, the \ref VLIB_conv_7x7_i8_c8s function performs
 *      a 7x7 Gaussian filtering, which creates a 3-pixel border around the image that contains invalid data. In the
 *      interest of performance, the gradient filter processes these border pixels, but later stages will discount
 *      them appropriately. Additionally, calculating the 2D gradients vectors will require a 1-pixel border. So the
 *      gradient and magnitude outputs will have a 4-pixel border of invalid data. The gradient filter has no
 *      memory boundary alignment requirements.
