/**
 * @par Introduction and Use Cases:
 *   Some vision applications require the data to be in the RGB format. If the input data is in the
 *   interleaved YUV422 color format, this function transforms the data into the sRGB format and separates
 *   the three color channels into separate buffers, color planes. Planarization is helpful because data transfers
 *   between external and internal memory are faster for contiguous data.
 *
 * @par Description:
 *   This function calculates RGB color space representation of pixels
 *   given in interleaved YUV422 format.
 * @par
 *   The matrix coefficients specified by the array coeff are typically as shown in
 *   Equation (a) for the case of RGB levels that correspond the 219-level range
 *   of Y. Expected ranges are [16..235] for Y and [16..240] for Cb and Cr.
 *   - coeff[] = { 0x2000, 0x2BDD, -0x0AC5, -0x1658, 0x3770 }; (a)
 * @par
 *   Alternatively, as shown in Equation (b), for the case of RGB conversion with
 *   the 219-level range of Y expanded to fill the full RGB dynamic range.
 *   Expected ranges are [16..235] for Y and [16..240] for Cb and Cr.
 *   - coeff[] = { 0x2543, 0x3313, -0x0C8A, -0x1A04, 0x408D }; (b)
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  *yc         Interleaved luma/chroma                      (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]   width      Width of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   pitch      Pitch of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   height     Height of input image(number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *   @param [in]   coeff      Matrix coefficients                          (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [out] *r          Pointer to L plane (8-bit)                   (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [out] *g          Pointer to A plane (8-bit)                   (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [out] *b          Pointer to B plane (8-bit)                   (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - width should be a multiple of 8, and greater than 0
 *  - pitch should be a multiple of 4, and >= width
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
