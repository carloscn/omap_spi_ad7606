/**
 * @par Introduction and Use Cases:
 *   YUV422 is a common imaging data format. If the information stored in the planar YUV format needs
 *   to be displayed it often needs to be interleaved first. This functions efficiently interleaves the YUV color
 *   channels.
 *
 * @par Description:
 *   This function interleaves the three YUV422 planar channels into a single YUV422 interleaved format.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *y          Luma plane (8-bit)                           (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]  *cr         Cr chroma plane (8-bit)                      (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]  *cb         Cb chroma plane (8-bit)                      (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]   width      Width of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *  @param [in]   pitch      Pitch of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *  @param [in]   height     Height of input image(number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *  @param [out] *yc         Interleaved luma/chroma                      (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - width should be a multiple of 16, and greater than 0
 *  - pitch should be a multiple of 16, and >= width
 *  - the *y buffer is of pitch bytes between start of each line
 *  - the *cr and *cb buffers is of pitch/2 bytes between start of each line
 *  - *yc buffer stores each line of width with no gap in between (pitch only applies
 *    to input buffers).
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *  - Internally, there are 2 modes:
 *    - Mode 1: Most efficient mode is when pitch == width
 *    - Mode 2: Kernel supports when pitch > width, but less performance
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.

 *  -# <em> Digital Image Processing </em> by R.C.Gonzales and R.E.Woods, Prentice-Hall, 2007
