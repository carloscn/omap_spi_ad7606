/**
 * @par Description
 *  Calculates Levels 1, 2, and 3 of an image pyramid for an 8-bit input image.
 *  The antialiasing filter used at each step is a 2x2 averaging.
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]   pIn[]     Input 8-bit input image                             (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]   inCols    Input Width of input image (in pixels)              (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]   inRows    Input Height of input image (in pixels)             (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [out]  pOut[]    Output 8-bit output data                            (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - inCols and inRows both must be a multiple of 8
 * - pIn and pOut must be 64-bit aligned
 * - pIn is a pointer to an (inCols x inRows) array of unsigned 8 bit data
 * - pOut is a pointer to an (inCols x inRows) x 21 / 64 array of unsigned 8 bit data
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
