/**
 * @par Description:
 *  The convolution kernel accepts seven rows of 'pitch' input pixels
 *  and produces one row of 'width' output pixels using the 7 pixel
 *  square filter mask provided on input.
 * @par
 *  The input mask is rotated 180 degrees before passing it to the
 *  convolution kernel.  The convolution sum is calculated as a point by
 *  point multiplication of the rotated mask with the input image. The
 *  49 resulting multiplications are summed together to produce a 32-bit
 *  intermediate sum. Overflow during accumulation is not prevented,
 *  though assumptions may be applied to filter gain to avoid overflow.
 * @par
 *  The user defined shift value is used to shift the convolution sum
 *  down to an 8-bit range prior to storing in the output array. The
 *  stored result is saturated as an unsigned 8-bit quantity. The mask is
 *  moved one column at a time, advancing the mask over the image until
 *  the entire 'width' is processed.
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  *imgin_ptr      Pointer to an input image of 8-bit pixels
 *   @param [out] *imgout_ptr     Pointer to an output image of 8-bit pixels
 *   @param [in]   width          Number of output pixels
 *   @param [in]   pitch          Number of columns in the image
 *   @param [in]  *mask_ptr       Pointer to an 8-bit filter mask
 *   @param [in]   shift          User specified right shift on sum
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - The input array and output array should not overlap
 *    - The output array must be 32-bit aligned
 *    - The width parameter must be a non-zero multiple of 2
 *    - The image pitch must be greater than or equal to the width
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C66x processors

/**
 * @par Description:
 *  As the third stage in Canny Edge Detection, non-maximum suppression identifies potential edge pixels. It
 *  suppresses all pixels whose edge strength is not a local maximum along the gradient direction.
 *
 * @par Method:
 *  Creates an 8-bit edge map labeling each pixel location as a non-Edge (0) or possible-edge (127).
 *  For each pixel location, the gradient direction is established. Two
 *  virtual points, say at a and b lying along the gradient direction on either side of the current location c are
 *  interpolated using the gradient magnitudes from surrounding neighbors. Locations that achieve a local
 *  maximum are regarded as possible edges, such as, Gmag(c) > Gmag(a) AND Gmag(c) >= Gmag(b);
 *  otherwise, these points are declared non-edges.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]   *pInMag           Pointer to array containing magnitude
 *   @param [in]   *pInGradX         Pointer to array containing X gradient
 *   @param [in]   *pInGradY         Pointer to array containing Y gradient
 *   @param [out]  *pOut             Pointer to output data
 *   @param [in]    width            Input width
 *   @param [in]    pitch            Input pitch
 *   @param [in]    height           input height
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - This function uses a 3x3 kernel and operates on rows instead of pixels. The
 *      function accepts 3 rows of input (Gx, Gy and Gmag) for every single row of the edge map that is
 *      calculated. This function introduces another 1-pixel border of invalid data around the center-portion of the
 *      edge map. Before feeding the edge map into the next stage of Canny edge detection (Hysteresis
 *      Thresholding), the 5-pixel border of invalid data should be set as non-edges. However, the 5-pixel border
 *      at the top and bottom of the edge map should be handled manually. The input pointers should be the top
 *      left corner of the image where the processing starts. Take care in adjusting the pointers according to the
 *      filter used for convolution.

/**
 * @par Description:
 *  Hysteresis thresholding is the final stage within Canny edge detection. With an edge map containing
 *  possible edges, hysteresis thresholding identifies and follows edges. Using both High and Low thresholds,
 *  it is able to maintain edge continuity by linking stronger edge segments that are connected to weaker
 *  segments. This stage is split into two functions \ref VLIB_doublethresholding (block based) and
 *  \ref VLIB_edgeRelaxation (Non block based).
 * @par
 *  This function is block based, and implements the first stage of hysteresis thresholding.
 *
 * @par Method:
 *  This function accepts an edge map, with each location labeled with values of either 0
 *  (non-edge) or 127 (possible-edge). It searches for locations where the magnitude is at or above the high
 *  threshold. Values in the edge map are modified from possible-edge
