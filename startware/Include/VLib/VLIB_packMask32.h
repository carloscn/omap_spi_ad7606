/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function packs 8-bit unpacked data to a 32-bit packed binary format
 * (each 32 bytes of input converts to 32 bits of output).
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  maskImage     Unpacked binary mask image buffer (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [out] mask32packed  32-bit packed binary mask buffer (32-bit packed)
 *    @param [in]  pixelCount    Number of pixels to process (UQ32.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be double-word aligned and not aliased.
 *    - The pixelCount must be a multiple of 8.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C64X+ fixed-point processors
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
