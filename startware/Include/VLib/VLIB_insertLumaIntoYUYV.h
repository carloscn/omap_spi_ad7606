/**
 * @par Introduction and Use Cases:
 *   When the image data is stored in the YUV422 format but the processing needs to be done on its
 *   luminance component only, it is often desirable to extract the Y component and store it in a separate
 *   buffer. This is particularly useful when data needs to be contiguous.  After the luma-only processing
 *   is complete, it may be desirable to reinsert the modified luma data back into the original YUV422
 *   image.
 *
 * @par Description:
 *   This function overwrites the luminance data of the pOutYUYV interleaved image using the the luma-only
 *   pInYbuffer data. The chrominance components of the output image are unaffected.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]     *pInY          Luma-only input image       (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]      inCols        Width of input image        (in luma pixels)
 *   @param [in]      inPitch       Pitch of pOutYUYV image     (in luma pixels)
 *   @param [in]      inRows        Height of input image       (in luma pixels)
 *   @param [in,out] *pOutYUYV      Output YUV422 image         (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - inCols should be a multiple of 16, and greater than 0
 *  - inPitch should be a multiple of 4, and >= inCols
 *  - inPitch applies to the number of luma pixels per row of the pOutYUYV buffer, it
 *    doesn't apply to the pInY buffer.  The pitch of the pInY buffer is assumed to be
 *    the same as inCols.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *  - Internally, there are 2 modes:
 *    - Mode 1: Most efficient mode is when inPitch == inCols
 *    - Mode 2: Kernel supports when inPitch > inCols, but less performance
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
