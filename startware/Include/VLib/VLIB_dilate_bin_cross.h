/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function implements binary dilation using a
 *  cross-shaped 3x3 mask on a bit-packed binary image. So, every bit of input and output
 *  images represents a pixel.
 * @verbatim

           0 1 0
    mask = 1 1 1    (3x3 cross)
           0 1 0
   @endverbatim
 *  The mask differs from the 3x3 square mask in that
 *  all corner pixels are disregarded (set to zero) and don't contribute to the
 *  binary result.  The dilation operator generates output pixels by performing a
 *  binary OR of all pixels under the cross-shaped input mask to generate an output
 *  pixel at the location of the center pixel of the mask.
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  in_data    Input image pointer (32-bit packed binary, UQ8.0)
 *    @param [out] out_data   Output image pointer (32-bit packed binary, UQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]  cols       Number of pixels (bits) to be processed (SQ31.0)
 *    @param [in]  pitch      Pitch of the input image (SQ31.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be four byte aligned and not aliased.
 *    - The inputs \c cols and \c pitch must be multiples of 32.
 *    - The bit-packed input and output are ordered the same way as pixels in the image.
 *      This is different from the IMGLIB requirement for bit-reversed binary pixels within
 *      32-bit words.
 *    - If the data is a region of interest within a larger image, then \c pitch < \c cols.
 *    - Border pixels will not contain valid data, in particular, two rows of the output,
 *      as well as two rightmost columns of the output do not contain valid data.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
