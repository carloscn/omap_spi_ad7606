/**
 * @par Description
 *  This algorithm accepts an image array which contains scores of feature candidates, and
 *  produces an 8-bit binary mask (0 or 255) of the image based on a programmable quality threshold
 *  and number of desired features.
 *  \par
 *  This function first runs a non-maximal suppression on the image using the programmable threshold (\c thresh) and
 *  filter width parameters (\c patch).  It then prunes these results out using the \c qualitypar threshold.  Then it
 *  sorts these results by ranking scores.  If the number of results are still greater than the number of desired features 
 *  (\c topNfeatures), then the results are further sorted by another round of a threshold-less nonmax suppression (spatial 
 *  diversity) using the \c mindist parameter.  The patch size in this round of pruning is defined by mindist*mindist.  In 
 *  other words, features which appear within the surrounding mindist*mindist pixels which have a lower score, are discarded.
 *  If spatial diversity prooves to prune too many features out of the list (features falls below topNfeatures), then spatial 
 *  diversity is internally disabled, and the top ranking topNfeatures features are returned without considering spatial diversity.

 * @par Assumptions
 *  - The only acceptable values for \c patch are 3, 5, and 7, representing non-maximum suppression filter masks sizes
 *    3x3, 5x5, and 7x7, respectively.
 *  - The non-maximum suppression \c pixIndex buffer (\c pixIndex) size should be (2*w*h+2)*sizeof(uint16_t) bytes
 *  - The non-maximum suppression internal buffer (\c internalBuf) size should be at least ((2 * \c patch) + (\c width * \c height))*sizeof(uint16_t) bytes
 *  - The intermediate buffer (\c outTemp) size should be at least (w*h)*sizeof(uint16_t) bytes and initialized to 0s.
 *  - The index buffer (\c ind) size should be at least (w*h)*sizeof(int32_t) bytes
 *  - The output buffer (\c out) size should be at least w*h bytes and initialized to 0s.
 *  - The output buffer (\c out) will contain a value of 255 for each location containing the filtered feature.
 *  - The value returned in \c good_points_number will be equal to or less than topNfeatures.  If less than topNfeatures, then the \c qualitypar may be too
 *    high to produce topNfeatures points.
