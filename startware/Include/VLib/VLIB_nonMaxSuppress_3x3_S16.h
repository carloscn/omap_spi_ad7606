 * @par Description
 *  This function compares the value of each input pixel against its neighbors. For an output pixel
 *  to be "on" (numerical value=255), the input pixel value must be both:
 *  - Greater than or equal to its neighbors values
 *  - Greater than the minimum threshold
 * @par
 *  If the above conditions are not met simultaneously, the output will be 0.
