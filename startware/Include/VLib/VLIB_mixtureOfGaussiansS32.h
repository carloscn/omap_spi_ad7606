/**
 * @par Description:
 *   Maintain a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for each pixel in a 32-bit video frame, and
 *   return a packed binary mask corresponding to the computed foreground regions for the input frame.
 *   This function assumes that the input stream contains a single channel (such as, luminance),
 *   and uses a maximum of 3 Gaussian components to model the pixel intensity variations.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *Im           Input image buffer                        (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]  *wt           Buffer for current weights                (SQ0.15)
 *  @param [in]  *mu           Buffer for current means                  (SQ8.23)
 *  @param [in]  *var          Buffer for current variances              (SQ16.15)
 *  @param [in]  *compNum      Buffer for indices indicating which mode a pixel belongs to  (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]  *updateMask8  Buffer for internal use                   (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [out] *Im_mask      Computed binary foreground mask           (32-bit packed binary)
 *  @param [in]   im_size      Pixel count of input image buffer         (SQ31.0)
 *  @param [in]   alpha        Update rate for weights                   (SQ0.15)
 *  @param [in]   rho          Update rate for heights                   (SQ0.31)
 *  @param [in]   delta        Mahalanobis distance threshold            (SQ4.27)
 *  @param [in]   T            Background subtraction threshold          (SQ0.15)
 *  @param [in]   ini_wt       Initial weight for new component          (SQ0.15)
 *  @param [in]   ini_var      Initial variance for new component        (SQ16.15)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - If the input image contains N pixels, the input buffers should have the following sizes:
 *     - wt: 3.N data elements
 *     - mu: 3.N data elements
 *     - var: 3.N data elements
 *     - compNum: N data elements
 *     - updateMask8: N data elements
 *     - Im_mask: N/32 data elements
 * - All buffers should be initialized to 0 before invoking the function for the first time.
 * - I/O buffers are assumed to be 64-bit aligned in memory.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
