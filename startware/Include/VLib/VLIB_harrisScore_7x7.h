/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function computes the Harris corner score for each pixel in a luma image. As input, the function takes the
 *  horizontal and vertical gradients of the image. This gives flexibility to the user in selecting the scale for
 *  gradient computations.
 *
 * @par
 * @param [in]  gradX[]  Horizontal gradient of the input luma image (SQ15.0)
 * @param [in]  gradY[]  Vertical gradient of the input luma image   (SQ15.0)
 * @param [in]  width    Image width                                 (SQ31.0)
 * @param [in]  height   Image height                                (SQ31.0)
 * @param [out] outm[]   Harris (cornerness) score                (exp=6 man=10)
 * @param [in]  k        Sensitivity parameter                       (UQ1.15)
 * @param [in]  buffer[] Scratch buffer                              (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Method
 *  For each pixel, the following equations together compute the 2x2 gradient covariance matrix M,
 *  where the summations are over 7x7 pixel neighborhoods:
 *  @verbatim

    M(1,1) = sum(gradX)^2
    M(1,2) = M(2,1) = sum(gradX x gradY)
    M(2,2) = sum(gradY)^2
    @endverbatim
 *  The cornerness score is defined as in the following equation, where k is a tunable sensitivity parameter, typically around 0.04. The underlying score computation 
 *  generates a signed 47 bit result, which is internally computed using signed 64-bit data types (int64_t). 
 *  @verbatim
    Score (signed 47-bit)   = det(M) - k * trace(M)^2
@endverbatim
 *  To save memory storing this data, the algorithm compresses this output to 16 bits using an approximation of the binary log.  Order relationships between different
 *  score values is maintained in this format, up to the quantization limits.  Such a format is superior compared to simple rounding in therms of quantization errors
 *  as the below format preserves maximum number of bits from the original score.  The exact format of Harris score stored in outm[] is as follows:
 *  @verbatim
 
    Exponent = 7bit, Mantissa = 9 bit (eg. EEEE EEEM MMMM MMMMb)
                                            where E: Exponent bits, M: Mantissa bits
    @endverbatim
 *  The exponent corresponds to the location of the leading non-redundant sign-bit in the score (where the lsb is location = 1, and msb is location = 64).  The mantissa contains the
 *  relevant bits (9 bits) starting from the leading non-redundant sign bit.
 *  @par
 *  The exponent is 0 if the absolute value of the score is less than 2^9.  If the absolute value of the score is greater, (lmb - 9) is stored in the exponent for positive scores,
 *  and -(lmb - 9) is stored in the exponent for negative scores.  For example, a signed score of 571717286 (= 0010 0010 0001 0011 1011 0110 1010 0110b) will be encoded as =
 *  (30-9)*2^9 + (571717286)>>(30-9)=11024.
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - Garbage may be written in the output margins, which are 3 pixels wide on each side. If the input gradient
 *  also has a margin of 1 pixel, then there is an overall output margin of 4 pixels.
 *  - This method uses a scratch buffer which must be at least 96 * \c width bytes.

 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
