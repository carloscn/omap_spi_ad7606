/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function computes the FAST12 score for a list of corners, and adds the score to the appropriate field of each feature.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]     *i             Pointer to the image buffer - Must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 *  @param [in]      stride        The stride of the image.
 *  @param [in,out] *features      The feature list - Must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 *  @param [in]      n_features    The length of the feature list.
 *  @param [in]      b             The FAST difference threshold. A pixel must be this much brighter/darker than the center to be considered "different".
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 * - \c i and \c features must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 * - \c features size should be at least as large as the \c n_features value.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed point processors.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
