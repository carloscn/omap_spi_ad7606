/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function can be used to calculate the horizontal portion of the next level of a pyramid. Given a pointer to a
 *  rectangular region of interest described by W (input data width), P (input data pitch),
 *  and H (input data height), this kernel returns (W-4)/2 x (H-3)/2 values. For example,
 *  if H=5, it will calculate a single row of results. The filter used is:
 *  @verbatim

            -1  -2  0   2   1
            -4  -8  0   8   4
    H5 =    -6  -12 0   12  6
            -4  -8  0   8   4
            -1  -2  0   2   1
    @endverbatim
 *  After the filtering step, the intermediate results are rounded and scaled to values
 *  0-255 (the output value of 128 indicates no gradient) as shown in the following equation:
 *  @verbatim

        Gh = ((conv2(A,H5) + 64) >> 7) + 128;
    @endverbatim
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *pIn     Input image                                     (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]  *pB      5 x (width-4) temporary array                   (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [in]   width   Input width                                     (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [in]   pitch   Pitch of the input data                         (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [in]   height  Input height                                    (UQ16.0)
 *  @param [out] *pOut    Output image                                    (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - (width-4) must be a multiple of 8
 * - pitch should be greater than or equal to width
 * - height must be greater than 4
 * - pIn is a pointer to an (pitch x height) array of unsigned 8 bit data
 * - pOut is a pointer to an (width-4)/2 x (height-3)/2 array of unsigned 8 bit data
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
