/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function accepts as input a pointer to the cost function to be minimized and an N-dimensional
 *  coordinate vector indicating the starting point of the search. The function returns the coordinates
 *  of the found minima and the actual minimum value.
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  *func          Pointer to cost function.
 *    @param [in]  *start         Pointer to array containing starting coordinates                         User-defined
 *    @param [in]  *init_step     Pointer to array containing the size of the initial step to be taken
 *                                in each dimension to form the initial simplex                            User-defined
 *    @param [in]   N             Dimensionality of the coordinate space                                     (SQ31.0)
 *    @param [in]   N_INV         Value equal to the reciprocal of N                                         (SQ0.15)
 *    @param [in]   MaxIteration  Maximum number of allowed iterations to find the minima                    (SQ31.0)
 *    @param [in]   EPSILON       Stopping criterion corresponding to a threshold on the difference        User-defined
 *                                between the largest and smallest values in the simplex at any iteration
 *    @param [in]  *v             Pointer to array of size N+1. For internal use.
 *    @param [in]  *f             Pointer to array of size N+1. For internal use.
 *    @param [in]  *vr            Pointer to array of size N. For internal use.
 *    @param [in]  *ve            Pointer to array of size N. For internal use.
 *    @param [in]  *vc            Pointer to array of size N. For internal use.
 *    @param [in]  *vm            Pointer to array of size N. For internal use.
 *    @param [in]  *addtlArgs     Pointer to structure containing additional arguments to cost function
 *    @param [out] *minPoint      Pointer to array to hold the coordinates of the found minima
 *    @param [out] *minValue      Pointer to variable to hold the minimum found value
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *  - All arrays should be double word aligned.
 *  - The stopping condition works as follows: If the difference between the largest and smallest values in the simplex at any iteration
 *    is smaller than EPSILON, the function terminates.
 *  - It is assumed that the cost function will have a 32-bit return value, and, as input, it will take 16-bit representation of the coordinates.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
