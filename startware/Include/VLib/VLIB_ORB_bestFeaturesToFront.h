/**
 * @par Description:
 *  Once the fast corners are detected and the harris scores for each have been obtained (\ref VLIB_ORB_getHarrisScore),
 *  this function can be called. If the number of features found (output->n_features) is less than or equal to the
 *  number of desired features requested (parameters->n_features_desired), then this function returns without doing
 *  anything. Otherise, it modifies the feature list (output->features and output->n_features) to return only the subset
 *  of features which have the highest Harris scores, though not necessarily sorted.  In case the final requested feature
 *  has the same score as others, all of the features of that score will be included in the modified list.  For this reason,
 *  the modified output->n_features parameter may be larger than the parameters->n_features_desired parameter.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *parameters   The parameters for ORB
 *  @param [in]  *input        The input data for ORB
 *  @param [out] *output       The output data for ORB
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 * - Pointer to the features list in \c output must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 * - One of the following FAST corner detectors is run prior to this function:
 *     - @ref VLIB_afast9_detectCorners
 *     - @ref VLIB_originalfast9_detectCorners
 *     - @ref VLIB_afast12_detectCorners
 *     - @ref VLIB_originalfast12_detectCorners
 * - @ref VLIB_ORB_getHarrisScore is run after the corner detector but before running this function.
 * - This function uses the input->scratchBuffer, so be sure that this buffer has been allocated at least
 *   (output->n_features + 1024) * 2 bytes.  In general, the input->scratchBuffer size can be overallocated to max
 *   possible requirement for ORB by calling the getRequiredScratchSize() function during initialization time.
 * - The input->scratchBuffer pointer must be 8 byte aligned.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed point processors.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
