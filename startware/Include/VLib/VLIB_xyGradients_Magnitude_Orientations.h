/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function returns the magnitude of gradients and binned orientation
 *  of the gradients of an 8-bit input image. The number of orientations are
 *  programmable using the \c bins parameter. Gradient orientation values
 *  range from 0-180 and hence the maximum number of bins can be 180.
 *
 * @par Method:
 *  The image gradients are calculated with pixel subtraction and not by Sobel filter.
 *  tan inverse of dy/dx gives the orientation direction. These orientations are mapped to
 *  one of the 0-(bins-1) bins. A pre computed look up table is built based on the number of bins.
 *  The computation cycle of this table depends on boundaries of the tan inverse values. The size
 *  of look-up table is 112kB. This gives the best through put of 1 cycle per pixel voting.
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  img[]    Input image array (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]  Width    Image width (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  Height   Image height (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  bins     Number of bins (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [out] Mag[]    Array for Magnitude (UQ32.0)
 *    @param [out] Orien[]  Array for Orientation (UQ32.0)
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
