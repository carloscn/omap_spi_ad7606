 * @par Description
 *  This function can be called just once to initialize the necessary buffers and constants.
 *
 * @par
 * @param [out] *LPoly    Buffer to hold the computed Legendre polynomial values (SQ0.15)
 * @param [in]   Order    Required order of moments                              (SQ31.0)
 * @param [in]   ImH      Image height                                           (SQ31.0)
 * @param [out] *Factor   Pointer to variable                                    (SQ0.15)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *   -   The largest order of moments supported is 40.
 *   -   LPoly is independent of the pixel intensities, and is dependent only on the size of the image (ImH) and the
 *       Order of the moment values required
 *   -   LPoly must be of dimension (Order+1)x(ImH)
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
