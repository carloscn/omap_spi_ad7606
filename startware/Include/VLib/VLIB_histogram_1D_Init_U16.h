/**
 * @par Description
 *  Initializes buffer for 1D histogram computation by \ref VLIB_histogram_1D_U16, or \ref VLIB_weightedHistogram_1D_U16.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]      *binEdges    Array containing the edges of the histogram bins (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]       numBins     Number of bins                                   (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in,out]  *histArray   Buffer for internal use                          (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - The values of binEdges must increase monotonically.
 * - histArray should be initialized to 0.
 * - histArray should have a size equal to the max possible value that the input quantity can take. This is
 *   done to save memory for cases where arrays values do not span the full range that the data type allows for.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
