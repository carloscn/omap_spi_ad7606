/**
 * @par Description:
 *  Accelerated FAST9.  This function detects and returns corners in image \c img based on FAST9 algorithm, but in a more DSP friendly manner.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *img                   Pointer to the image buffer - Must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 *  @param [in]   img_width             Image width - Must be a multiple of 8.
 *  @param [in]   img_height            Image height - Must be a multiple of 8.
 *  @param [in]   img_pitch            Image pitch - Number of bytes between the beginning of each line in memory. Must be a multiple of 8.
 *  @param [in]   marginPixels          Fast corners will not be found within this distance from the edge of the image
 *  @param [in]   differenceThreshold   The FAST difference threshold. A pixel must be this much brighter/darker than the center to be considered "different"
 *  @param [in]   sortResults           By default, the feature list is sorted only in y direction, not x.  Setting this to TRUE causes the features list
 *                                      to be sorted in both x and y directions. For non-maxima suppression, the sort operation must be
 *                                      performed, so the list is sorted is x and y. However, this function is faster to not sort.
 *  @param [out] *features              Pointer to a buffer to hold feature locations(x,y) - Must be double-word(64-bit) aligned. Size depends on max features in the use case.
 *  @param [in]  *scratchbuff           Internal scratch buffer of size = img_width elements (img_width * 2 bytes)

 * @par Assumptions:
 * - \c img and \c features must both be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 * - \c img_width and \c img_height must both be a multiple of 8 and not less than \ref CORB_MIN_IMAGE_WIDTH and \ref CORB_MIN_IMAGE_HEIGHT, respectively.
 * - \c img_pitch must be a multiple of 8 and not less than \ref CORB_MIN_IMAGE_WIDTH.
 * - Max number of features to find is set to \ref CORB_MAX_FEATURES, therefore, the \c features buffer should be allocated
 *   \ref CORB_MAX_FEATURES*sizeof(\ref CORBFeature)
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed point processors.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
