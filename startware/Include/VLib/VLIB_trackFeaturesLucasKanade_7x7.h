/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function considers a 7x7 patch centered about the feature coordinate.
 *  Bilinear sampling is used so that the tracked feature coordinates have sub-pixel accuracy.
 *  The number of iterations typically can be between 6 and 10. This API also calculates
 *  transaltion error ( sum of the absolute difference ) between two frames.
 *
 *  The error contains the sum of absolute differences between the window in im1 around (x,y) and
 *  the window in im2 around (outx,outy). Window size is equal to patch size. This error can be
 *  used to discard features whose track_error exceeds a user defined threshold. For features that
 *  have moved very close to the borders of the image, error value returned is 65535.
 *  The algorithm is inverse compositional.

                                   feature points needs to be evaluated.
                                                                   (UQ8.0)

                                   of flow vectors in x and y direction is
                                   less than this threshold then iteration
                                   loop is terminated. For no termination
                                   this threshold can be set to zero
                                                                   (UQ32.0)
 * @param [in]     scratch[]      Scratch memory. It is always good to
                                   allocate scratch buffer in L1D. Total size of
                                   the scratch buffer required is 839
                                                                   (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - The input pointer 'scratch' should be pointing at a memory buffer of 839 bytes.
 *   It should ideally be located in on-chip memory.
 * - The parameters outx and outy are expected to contain initial estimates of feature coordinates in im2.
 *   The function will overwrite these values with refined values. If initial estimates are not known, they
 *   should typically be equal to feature coordinates of im1 (i.e. parameter x & y).
 * - The parameters x, y, outx and outy are expected to be in Q12.4 format. So, the pixel level coordinates
 *   should be left shifted by four before passing them to the function.
 * - No feature coordinates are rejected, so the length of outputs outx and outy is same as the length
 *   of inputs x and y.
 * - Number of features should be multiple of two.
 * - Return value from this function is total number of internal loop execution. If any un-valid
 *   parameter is passed to this kernel then this value returned will be zero. In no early exit
 *   scenario, this value will be equal to max_iters*nfeatures.  If there is early exit for some features,
 *   this value will be between nfeatures <= value < max_iters*nfeatures.  This information can be used to
 *   help aid in performance reporting and the adjustment of the setting of the max_iters paramter.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
