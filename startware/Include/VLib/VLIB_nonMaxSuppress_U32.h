/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function implements a non-maximum suppression algorithm with programmable filter size.  It compares
 *  the value of each input pixel against its neighbors.  For an output pixel to be "on" (coordinate pair
 *  included in the \c pixIndex list), the input pixel value must be both:
 *  - Greater than or equal to its neighbors
 *  - Greater than the \c threshold value
 *
 *  If the above conditions are not met simultanously, the output coordinate will not be included in the \c pixIndex list.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *im            Input image                                 (UQ32.0)
 *  @param [in]   w             Image width                                 (SQ31.0)
 *  @param [in]   h             Image height                                (SQ31.0)
 *  @param [in]   filterWidth   Filter width                                (SQ31.0)
 *  @param [in]   threshold     Threshold for the Maxima                    (UQ32.0)
 *  @param [in]  *buffer        Buffer for internal use                     (UQ32.0)
 *  @param [out] *pixIndex      List of coordinates of non-maxima locations (SQ15.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - The only acceptable values for \c filterWidth are 3, 5, and 7, representing filter masks sizes 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7, respectively.
 *  - The internal buffer (\c buffer) size should be at least ((2 * \c filterWidth) + (\c w * \c h))*sizeof(uint32_t) bytes
 *  - The output buffer (\c pixIndex) size should be (2*w*h+2)*sizeof(uint16_t) bytes
 *  - The format of the output buffer (\c pixIndex) is as follows:
 *      - \c pixIndex[] = {numPoints, 0, y1, x1, y2, x2, y3, x3,  yn, xn}
 *          - where \e n = numPoints = the number of points contained in the list.
 *  - Due the the method of filtering, the output list will not include pixel coordinates which are located within the border of the
 *    input image.  The number of border pixels is defined by the following equation: border pixels = (filterWidth-1)/2.
 * 
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
