/**
 * @par Description:
 *  The function VLIB_updateUWRVarianceS16() updates the uniformly-weighted running
 *  variance of a video buffer. If the foreground mask flag bit of either the newest
 *  or the oldest data is set, the running variance is not updated.
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [out] updatedVar           Updated running 16-bit variance (SQ12.3)
 *    @param [in]  previousVar          Current running 16-bit variance (SQ12.3)
 *    @param [in]  updatedMean          Updated running 16-bit mean (SQ8.7)
 *    @param [in]  previousMean         Current running 16-bit mean (SQ8.7)
 *    @param [in]  newestData           Most recent Luma buffer (SQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]  newestMask32packed   Most recent foreground object mask (32-bit packed)
 *    @param [in]  oldestMask32packed   Oldest foreground object mask (32-bit packed)
 *    @param [in]  pixelCount           Number of pixels to process (UQ32.0)
 *    @param [in]  frameCount           Nunmber of frames in video buffer being averaged (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be double-word aligned and not aliased.
 *    - The pixelCount must be a multiple of 8.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
