/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function uses histogram equalization to redistribute the intensity values of an image
 *  to span the full dynamic range (0-255) of an 8-bit per pixel image.  Intermediate computation
 *  uses fixed point integer math (UQ24.8).
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  image[]         8-bit input image array to one of the image channels   (UQ8.0)
 *   @param [in]  n               Number of pixels in the input image (< 262144)         (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]  t_hist[]        Array of scratch buffer to calculate the histogram     (SQ15.0)
 *   @param [out] histeq_image[]  8-bit output image array                               (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All array buffers must be 8-byte aligned.
 *  - \c n must be a multiple of 8, and should be less than 262144
 *  - \c t_hist[] size should be 1024*sizeof(int16_t) = 2048 bytes
 *  - \c t_hist[] should be initialised to all zeros.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
