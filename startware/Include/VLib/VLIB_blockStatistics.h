/**
 * @par Description:
 *   This routine accepts an 8-bit grayscale input image of size imageWidth by
 *   imageHeight with a stride of imageStride. The image is divided into
 *   non-overlapping blocks of statBlockWidth by statBlockHeight. This kernel
 *   computes block statistics over these non-overlapping blocks. Statistics
 *   calculated are block minima, block maxima, block mean and block variance.
 *   Output of minimum, maximum , mean and variance are available in buffer
 *   pMinimum, pMaximum, pMean, pVariance respectively. User needs to allocate
 *   these output buffers appropriately.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  pInput[]         input data pointer                                (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [in]  imageStride      stride between input lines, in elements           (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  imageWidth       width of input data, in elements                  (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  imageHeight      height of input data, in elements                 (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  statBlockWidth   width of the statistics block                     (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [in]  statBlockHeight  height of the statistics block                    (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [out] pMinimum[]       data pointer for minimum value for each block     (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [out] pMaximum[]       data pointer for maximum value for each block     (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [out] pMean[]          data pointer for mean value for each block        (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [out] pVariance[]      data pointer for variance value for each block    (UQ32.0)
 *   @param [in]  pScratch[]       data pointer for scratch buffer                   (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [in]  mode             optimization mode (0 or 1)                        (UQ8.0 )
 *
 * @par Method
 *  -# Minimum : This value is minimum value of the all the pixels present in given block
 *  -# Maximum : This value is maximum value of the all the pixels present in given block
 *  -# Mean    : This vlaue is equal to sum of all the pixels present in given block, which
 *               is equal to N*actual_mean of the pixels. Where N is total number of pixel
 *               in a block. In order to get actual mean, user must divide outputs by the block
 *               size.
 *  -# Variance: This value is sum of squares of all the pixel present in given block, times the
 *               number of pixels in the block, minus the square of sums of the block.
 *               (blockSize*sumSq - (blockSum)^2)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - Input image data is of 8 bits.
 *    - Total number of pixels in each block should not be more than 256.
 *    - Output buffers needs to be allocated by user. If total number of
 *      output block is N then user needs to allocate the 'pMinimum' buffer
 *      of size (N+7). This 7 extra space is coming due to implementation
 *      restriction. Similarly for 'pVariance' user need to allocate
 *      4*(N+7).
 *    - Scratch buffer needs to be allocated by user. Size of the scratch buffer
 *      depends on value of 'mode'. If mode is zero then scratch buffer size
 *      required is 64 bytes. If the mode is one then size of scratch buffer
 *      required is (imageWidth*statBlockHeight + 64)
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - There are two optimization flow has been implemented for this kernel.
 *      These two flow can be selected by passing the value of 'mode' as either
 *      '0' and '1'.
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed and floating point processors
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
