/**
 * @par Description
 *  Histogram computation for 16-bit vector valued variables of multiple dimensions.
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]     *X            Array of input values, data arranged in planar form                        (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]      numX         Number of individual vector elements in X                                  (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]      dimX         Dimensionality of vectors in X                                             (SQ31.0)
 *   @param [in]      binWeight    Value to accumulate in histogram bins                                      (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *numBins      Array of size dimX, each element specifies the number of bins required in that dimension (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *normVals     Array of size dimX, each element containing the normalization factor for that dimension  (UQ0.16)
 *   @param [in]     *scrap        Buffer of size numX, for internal use                                      (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]     *H1           Buffer of size equal to total number of bins, for internal use             (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in,out] *H            Array of size equal to total number of bins to hold computed histogram     (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - The vectors in X should be arranged in planar form (see Example below).
 * - H, scrap, and H1 should each be initialized to 0.
 * - numX should be a multiple of 2
 * - The normalization factor normVals[k] for each dimension k should be set as in following equation, where M is
 *   the maximum value in dimension k, and d > 0:
 *     - normVals[k] = 1/(M+d)
 *
 * @par Example
 *
 * Assume a 3-dimensional quantity:
 *  @verbatim
  F = [9 2 3;
       5 3 5;
       8 1 3;
       4 2 3;
       7 1 1];
@endverbatim
 *
 * Where the maximum possible value in each dimension is as follows:
 *  @verbatim
  Dim 1 = 10
  Dim 2 = 4
  Dim 3 = 5
@endverbatim
 *
 * The required output is a histogram with 352 bins:
 *  @verbatim
  Dim 1 = 3 bins
  Dim 2 = 5 bins
  Dim 3 = 2 bins
@endverbatim
 *
 * The following is the form of the input:
 *  @verbatim
  X = [9 5 8 4 7 2 3 1 2 1 3 5 3 3 1];
  numX = 5;
  dimX = 3;
  binWeight = 1 (or 1/5 for a normalized histogram)
  numBins = [3 5 2];
  normVals = [1/11 1/5 1/6] * 65536;
  scrap = array of 0s of size 5
  H1 = array of 0s of size 30
  H = array of 0s of size 30
@endverbatim
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
