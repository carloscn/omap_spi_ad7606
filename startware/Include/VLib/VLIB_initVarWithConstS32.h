/**
* @par Description:
*  The function VLIB_initVarWithConstS32() is used to initialize a running variance
*  buffer with a constant variance initial estimate.  In this process, it is assumed
*  that the initial value "constVar" is in SQ16.15 format.
*
* @par
*    @param [out] runningVar         Exponentially weighted running variance (SQ16.15)
*    @param [in]  constVar           Initial variance (SQ16.15)
*    @param [in]  pixelCount         Number of pixels to process (UQ32.0)
*
* @par Assumptions:
*    - I/O buffers are assumed to be double-word aligned and not aliased.
*    - The pixelCount must be a multiple of 4.
*
* @par Implementation Notes:
*    - This code is fully interruptible
*    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
*
* @par Benchmarks:
*  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
