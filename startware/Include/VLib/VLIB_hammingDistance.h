/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function implements hamming distance on a 2D array of bytes.
 *  The first dimension is an array of xSize bytes, while the second dimension is of ySize arrays.
 *  There are two modes.
 *    - Mode 0 - One-to-One i.e., pHammingDistance[i] = HammingDistance(pString1[i], pString2[i]); i = 0,1,2, ...ySize-1
 *    - Mode 1 - Many-to-One i.e., pHammingDistance[i] = HammingDistance(pString1[i], pString2[0]); i = 0,1,2, ...ySize-1
 *  @par
 *  pHamming distance is an array of ySize words.
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  pString1             Pointer to an array of byte arrays          (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]  pString2             Pointer to an array of byte arrays          (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]  xSize                Number of bytes in the first dimension      (UQ32.0)
 *    @param [in]  ySize                Number of rows (size of second dimension)   (UQ32.0)
 *    @param [in]  mode                 0: one-to-one\n
 *                                      1: many-to-one
 *    @param [in]  xPitch               Number of bytes between start of each string (UQ32.0)
 *    @param [out] pHammingDistance     Output array of hamming distances (size = ySize) (UQ32.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be four byte aligned and not aliased.
 *    - xSize is assumed to be a multiple of 4.
 *    - For Mode 0, pString1 and pString2 should be equal size (xSize * ySize) bytes
 *    - For Mode 1, pString1 should be of size (xSize * ySize) bytes, while pString2 should
 *      at least be of size xSize bytes.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
