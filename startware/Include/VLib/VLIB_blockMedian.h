/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function finds the lower median value of each block in an 8-bit image.
 *  The blocks are defined by separate parameters for block width and heights,
 *  and step sizes in the horizontal and vertical directions.  Having step size
 *  parameters means that the neighboring blocks can be more flexibly configured
 *  as follows:
 *      - Overlapping (step size < block size),
 *      - Non-overlapping but adjacent (step size == block size), or
 *      - Sparse (step size > block size)
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  pInput        Input image pointer                        (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [out] pMedian       Output median array pointer                (UQ8.0)
 *    @param [in]  pScratch      Scratch buffer                             (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  imageWidth    Width of the image                         (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  imageHeight   Height of the image                        (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  imagePitch    Pitch of the input image (distance between start of each line) (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  blockWidth    Width of the blocks                        (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  blockHeight   Height of the blocks                       (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  stepSizeHorz  Step Size of the blocks in the X direction (UQ16.0)
 *    @param [in]  stepSizeVert  Step Size of the blocks in the Y direction (UQ16.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be not aliased.
 *    - Output buffer \c pMedian should be of size [(imageHeight - blockHeight)/stepSizeVert + 1]
 *      * [(imageWidth - blockWidth)/stepSizeHorz + 1]
 *    - Scratch buffer \c pScratch should be of size 1024 and allocated in fast memory
 *    - pInput and pScratch buffers should be 8 byte aligned in memory.
 *    - Maximum number of pixels in a single block that can have the same value is 65535.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
 *
 * @par Performance Notes:
 *    - Due to horizontal processing pipeline efficiency, the cycles per unit 'N' go down with
 *      respect to increasing blockWidth value
 *        - Where N = ((imageHeight - blockHeight)/stepSizeVert + 1) *
 *          ((imageWidth - blockWidth)/stepSizeHorz + 1) * blockHeight*blockWidth
