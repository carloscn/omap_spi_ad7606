/**
* @par Description:
*  The function VLIB_subtractBackgroundS32() implements a statistical background
*  segmentation algorithm. For each pixel, the running mean and variance statistics
*  are available.  Given a novel luma observation, we test whether its squared
*  distance from the mean is larger than a multiplicative factor of its variance.
*  For a pixel to pass the test, its distance should also be greater than a
*  predefined global threshold, designed to capture inherent camera noise. When
*  these conditions are satisfied, the observation is deemed to stem from a
*  foreground object (and not from the modeled background), and the corresponding
*  mask pixel value is set to 1.
*
* @par
*    @param [out] mask32packed     Binary mask to be determined (32-bit packed)
*    @param [in]  newLuma          Most recent Luma data (UQ8.0)
*    @param [in]  runningMean      Exponentially weighted running mean buffer (SQ8.23)
*    @param [in]  runningVar       Exponentially weighted running variance buffer (SQ16.15)
*    @param [in]  thresholdGlobal  Global threshold value (SQ16.15)
*    @param [in]  thresholdFactor  Multiplicative factor for threshold (SQ4.27)
*    @param [in]  PixelCount       Number of pixels to process (UQ32.0)
*
* @par Assumptions:
*    - I/O buffers are assumed to be double-word aligned and not aliased.
*    - The PixelCount must be a multiple of 32.
*
* @par Implementation Notes:
*    - This code is fully interruptible
*    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
*
* @par Benchmarks:
*  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
