/**
 * @par Description:
 *   This routine accepts an 8-bit grayscale input image of size imageWidth by
 *   imageHeight with a stride of imagePitch and calculates gray scale
 *   co-occurrence for multiple angles. Angles are taken in terms of
 *   offsets in row and columns. E.g. rowOffset = -D and colOffset = D
 *   indicates pixel at 45 degree down from current pixel. In single call of this
 *   API output matrix can be calculated for multiple offsets ( or angles).
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  pInput[]         input data pointer                                (UQ8.0 )
 *   @param [in]  pCoMatrix[]      Array of pointers for output matrices             (UQ16.0*)
 *   @param [in]  imageWidth       width of input data, in elements                  (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  imageHeight      height of input data, in elements                 (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  imagePitch       stride between input lines, in elements           (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  loPixelVal       Input values less than or equal to lowPixelVal    (UQ8.0 )
 *                                 are scaled to 0.
 *   @param [in]  hiPixelVal       Input values more than or equal to hiPixelVal     (UQ8.0 )
 *                                 are scaled to (numLevels -1).
 *   @param [in]  numLevels        The range [lowPixelVal hiPixelVal] is divided     (UQ16.0 )
 *                                 into  numLevels equal width bins and values in a
 *                                 bin get mapped to a single gray level.
 *   @param [in]  numOffsets       Number of  directions for which out matrix is     (UQ8.0 )
 *                                 needed.
 *   @param [in]  rowOffsets       Pointer for the offsets in Y direction for pixel  (SQ8.0 )
 *                                 in interest and neighbour pixel.
 *   @param [in]  colOffsets       Pointer for the offsets in X direction for pixel  (SQ8.0 )
 *                                 in interest and neighbour pixel.
 *   @param [in]  scratch          Pointer to scratch area. This is not mandatory    (UQ8.0* )
 *                                 input.Application can provide this value as NULL,
 *                                 if scratch memory can not be provided. Cycle
 *                                 consumed will be lesser when scratch buffer is
 *                                 provided. Scratch buffer size need to be
 *                                 8*numLevels*numLevels, when it is provided. API
 *                                 checks the value of this argument against NULL, and
 *                                 accordingly appropriate flow chosen.
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - Input image data is of 8 bits.
 *    - Output data is saturated to 16 bits
 *    - I/O buffers are assumed to be not aliased.
 *    - Scratch buffer \c scratch should be 8-byte aligned in memory.
 *    - Active width (imageWidth - abs(colOffset)) should be at least 16 pixels
 *    - output buffer and scratch buffers are internally cleared to zero
 *    - loPixelVal value should be less than hiPixelVal
 *    - numLevels should be within the range [2 .. 256]
 *    - numLevels should be less than or equal hiPixelVal - loPixelVal + 1
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - There are two optimization flows have been implemented for this kernel.
 *      These two flow can be selected by:
 *          1: passing a valid scratch buffer or
 *          2: passing a NULL (0) pointer as the scratch buffer pointer
 *      Optimization flow with scratch buffer will have faster performance.
 *      Also if (hiPixelValue-loPixelValue+1)/numLevels is a positive power of two AND numLevels<=64
 *      then LUT usage while binning the pixels can be avoided which will give further
 *      performance improvement when the scratch buffer is passed.
 *    - For lower image size, non scratch flow will give better cycle performance number.
 *    - For larger image size , scratch buffer flow will give better cycle performance number.
 *    - In scratch buffer flow, 4 temporary histograms are used which needs to be reset to zero internally.
