/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function implements the 1st order vertical IIR filter on an 8-bit input array.
 *
 * @par
 * @param [out] *out            Filter output image             (UQ8.0)
 * @param [in]  *in             Input luma image                (UQ8.0)
 * @param [in]   width          Input Width                     (SQ31.0)
 * @param [in]   height         Image height                    (SQ31.0)
 * @param [in]   weight         Filter coefficient              (SQ15.0)
 * @param [in]  *boundaryTop    Array of top-boundary values    (UQ8.0)
 * @param [in]  *boundaryBottom Array of bottom-boundary values (UQ8.0)
 * @param [in]  *scratch        Scratch buffer                  (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 * - The scratch buffer must be at least 4 x height bytes.
 * - The image width and height needs to be a multiple of 4.
 * - The input and output image buffers need to be double-word aligned.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
