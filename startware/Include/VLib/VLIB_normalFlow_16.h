/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function takes as input the x and y gradients, the gradient magnitude, and the pixel-wise image difference
 *  and computes the normal flow vectors in the x and y directions.
 *
 * @par
 *    @param [in]  *imDiff        Image difference array            (SQ15.0)
 *    @param [in]  *Emag          Array for magnitude               (SQ15.0)
 *    @param [in]  *Ex            Array for X direction gradients   (SQ15.0)
 *    @param [in]  *Ey            Array for y direction gradients   (SQ15.0)
 *    @param [in]  *LUT           LUT array for integer division    (SQ0.15)
 *    @param [in]   T             Threshold on gradient magnitude   (SQ15.0)
 *    @param [in]   numEls        Number of input pixels            (SQ31.0)
 *    @param [out] *normalFlowU   Normal flow U array               (SQ8.7)
 *    @param [out] *normalFlowV   Normal flow V array               (SQ8.7)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  -  The LUT (look-up table) array should hold values such that LUT[n] = X, where X is the value 1/n represented in SQ0.15 format.
 *  -  The LUT array size should be at least equal to the largest expected value in the Emag array + 1.
 *  -  The threshold, T, on gradient magnitude ensures that only those pixels with gradient magnitude greater than T will be processed.
 *     Normal flow values for pixels that do not pass the threshold will be 0.
 *  -  Minimum number of pixels allowed is 20 (numPixels >= 20)
 *  -  Number of pixels to be processed should be a multiple of 4.
 *  -  All arrays should be double word (64-bit) aligned.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
