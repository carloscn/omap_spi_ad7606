/**
 * @par Introduction and Use Cases:
 *   YUV422 is a common imaging data format. If the YUV color channels are interleaved, as is often the
 *   case, this function is usually beneficial for improving the performance of vision applications, as it
 *   separates the three color channels into separate buffers, color planes. This is helpful because data
 *   transfers between external and internal memory are faster for contiguous data.
 *
 * @par Description:
 *   This function separates the three channels of an interleaved YUV422 data block into separate equal sized
 *   buffers.  Currently, the algorithm does not decimate the luma component, butupsamples the chroma components by
 *   duplicating each chroma component.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *yc         Interleaved luma/chroma                      (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [in]   width      Width of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *  @param [in]   pitch      Pitch of input image (number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *  @param [in]   height     Height of input image(number of luma pixels) (in pixels)
 *  @param [out] *y          Luma plane (8-bit)                           (in pixels)
 *  @param [out] *cr         Cr chroma plane (8-bit)                      (UQ8.0)
 *  @param [out] *cb         Cb chroma plane (8-bit)                      (UQ8.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be 64-bit aligned.
 *  - width should be a multiple of 16, and greater than 0
 *  - width <= pitch
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
