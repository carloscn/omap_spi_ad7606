/**
 * @par Description
 *  This function accepts as input two arrays, p and q, of size N containing the discrete
 *  probability distributions. It returns the Bhattacharya distance, B, between p and q as
 *  a 32-bit unsigned integer as defined in the following equation:
 *  @verbatim
     B = sqrt(1- SUM((sqrt(p(i)*q(i))))) , for all 0 < i < N ,SUM stands for summation.
@endverbatim
 *
 * @par
 *   @param [in]  *X    Pointer to array containing first probability distribution        (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]  *Y    Pointer to array containing second probability distribution       (UQ16.0)
 *   @param [in]   N    Number of elements in the probability distributions               (UQ32.0)
 *   @param [out] *D    Pointer to variable to store the computed Bhattacharya Distance   (UQ32.0)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *  - All arrays should be double-word aligned.
 *  - Bhattacharya distance is defined on probability distribution functions. This implies that the elements in
 *    X and Y should sum to 1, respectively.
 *  - There should be a minimum of four elements in X and Y.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
