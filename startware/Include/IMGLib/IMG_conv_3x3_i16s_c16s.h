/**
 * @par Description:
 *  The convolution kernel accepts three rows of 'pitch' input pixels 
 *  and produces one row of 'width' output pixels using the three pixel
 *  square filter mask provided on input. 
 * @par
 *  The input mask is rotated 180 degrees prior to calculating the 
 *  convolution sum.  The convolution sum is calculated as a point by 
 *  point multiplication of the rotated mask with the input image. The 
 *  9 resulting multiplications are summed together to produce a 32-bit 
 *  intermediate sum. Overflow during accumulation is not prevented,
 *  though assumptions may be applied to filter gain to avoid overflow.
 * @par
 *  The user defined shift value is used to shift the convolution sum 
 *  down to a 16-bit range prior to storing in the output array. The 
 *  stored result is saturated accordingly. The mask is moved one column 
 *  at a time, advancing the mask over the image until the entire 'width'  
 *  is covered.  
 * @par 
 *    @param imgin_ptr    Pointer to an input image of 16-bit pixels
 *    @param imgout_ptr   Pointer to an output image of 16-bit pixels         
 *    @param width        Number of output pixels                    
 *    @param pitch        Number of columns in the image             
 *    @param mask_ptr     Pointer to a 16-bit filter mask             
 *    @param shift        User specified right shift on sum
 *
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 *  The natural C implementation has no restrictions. The optimized     
 *  intrinsic C code has restrictions as noted in Assumptions below.    
 *
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 *    - The input and output arrays should not overlap  
 *    - The output image array must be 32-bit aligned
 *    - The mask and input image array must be 16-bit aligned.
 *    - The width parameter must be a non-zero multiple of 2
 *    - The image pitch must be greater than or equal to the width and
 *      a multiple of 2
 *    - Internal accuracy of the computations is 32 bits. To ensure  
 *      correctness on a 16 bit input data, the maximum permissible
 *      filter gain in terms of bits is 16-bits i.e. the cumulative sum
 *      of the absolute values of the filter coefficients should not 
 *      exceed 2^16 - 1.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 *    - This code is fully interruptible
 *    - This code is compatible with C64x+ processors
 *
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See IMGLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
